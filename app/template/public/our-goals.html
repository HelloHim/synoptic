                                We started this journey by creating technology that will help cambodians
                                to understand when they should expect a flood or drought and allow them
                                to understand when their rivers have water safe for farming, drinking, washing,
                                bathing and more.

                            Alerts are provided on the weather page for when their is expected to be a drought or flood
                            dependant on the rainfall and water levels recorded over the past week.

                                We want to reduce the effect of school, business and house flooding in Pu Ngaol
                                by giving them access to warnings of potential future floods allowing them to prepaire early.

                                This also helps farmers to understand when they should begin to prepaire their fields of the season and
                                also predict their potential yeald to be able to put in specific measures to ensure they can sustain themself and their
                                families.

                                their is an increased likelyhood of a storm which could cause them to get sick or stuck on mud tracks or even potentially
                                injoured. furthermore this reduces overcrowding in hospitals.
